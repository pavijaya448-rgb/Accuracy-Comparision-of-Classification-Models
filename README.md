# Accuracy-Comparision-of-Classification-Models
Accuracy-Comparision-of-Classification-Models The project shows the techniques of evalution of models and their metrices. The dataset used is Mushroom. To predict mushroom is good or bad by considering various factors.
The project systematically evaluates and compares the performance of Random Forest and AdaBoost classifiers using accuracy metrics and performed metrices such as confusion matrix, and classification reports to assess their effectiveness andÂ reliability.
